> 树和图是最常见的非线性数据结构

## 定义

A tree T is a collection of nodes(element).

The collection can be empty;

otherwise, a tree consists of a distinguished node r , called the root, and zero or more non-empty (sub)trees T1,T2, ……, Tk



- 结点的度 = 直接子结点个数
- 树的度 = 所有结点度的最大值



Leaf: element whose degree is 0 

Branch: element whose degree is not 0



Level: 

the level of root is 0 (1)

the level of an element=the level of its parent+1

Depth(Height) of a tree: the maximum level of its elements



## 二叉树

### 定义

A binary tree t is a finite (possibly empty)  collection of elements.

When the binary tree is not empty:

• It has a root element 

• The remaining elements(if any) are partitioned into two binary trees, which are called the left and right subtrees of t. 

### 性质

1. The drawing of every binary tree with n  elements (n>0) has exactly n-1 edges.（也是树的性质）
2. The number of elements at level i is at  most 2^i^ (i>=0)
3. A binary tree of height h, h>=0, has at  least h+1 and at most 2^h+1^ –1 elements in it.
4. If number of leaves is n~0~ , and the number of  the 2 degree elements is n~2~, then n~0~=n~2~+1.
5. The height of a binary tree that contains n  (n>=0) element is at most n-1 and at least  `Ceiling(log2 (n+1))-1`
6. Let i, 0<=i<=n-1,be the number assigned to an element of a **complete** binary tree. The following are true.
   1) if i=0, then this element is the root of the binary tree.
     if i>0,then the parent of this element has been assigned the number `Floor((i-1)/2)`
   2) if 2* i+1>=n,then this element has no left child. Otherwise,its left child has been assigned the number 2*i+1
   3) if 2* i+2>=n, then this element has no right child,  Otherwise its right child has been assigned the number  2*i+2

### 完全二叉树

A binary tree of height h that contains exactly 2^h+1^ -1  elements is called a full binary tree.
